# Tableau-Projects
These are dynamic tableau projects that help transform the data into useful information.




Sales Analysis: The first worksheet "Sales by Year" displays time series data showing the sales from 2011 to 2014. Market was added to colors in order to display the 7 different international markets all on the same graph. I also created a dynamic tooltip that can display the sales and profits for a given market.
The second worksheet "Sales and Profit by Order Priority" is a scatterplot that shows how sales and profit are affected by order priority in each market. Medium priority orders have high sales and profit while critical orders have low profit and sales. This may be because it costs us more to have to pay to expedite ship items that are a critical priority. I created a dynamic tooltip for this project is in paragraph format to allow the reader to quickly understand the meaning of each dot on the scatterplot.
